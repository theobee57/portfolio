### Objective
The objective of this project was to conduct exploratory data analysis on Netflix data to uncover insights into movies from the 1990s, a pivotal decade in the modern film industry, and provide answers to specific business questions.

### Tools
I  used Pandas for manipulating the dataset, Matplotlib for visualization, and Python for programming.
### Procedure
Having loaded pre-cleaned Netflix data into a pandas DataFrame, I subsetted the DataFrame to include only movies released between 1990 and 1999.

I then created a histogram based on the 'Duration' column. This visualization enabled me to determine the distribution of movie lengths in that decade, especially the most common movie duration and other insights.

I applied a second filter to isolate the 'Action' genre. Then I iterated through this filtered dataset using a for loop with a counter variable to count each movie that met various duration criteria.
### Impact
The results had a direct impact on Netflix's content strategy, enhancing user experience and refining its market position.
